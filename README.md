Rock Paper Scissors game based initially on the Odin Project challenge (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors) with UI styling adapted from frontendmentor's challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH).

This was my first time building an app that involved transitions within a single page using vanilla JS. My challenge was mostly in trying to not let my code get incredibly messy and learning to name things well.

Next steps are to add mobile-friendly styling and/or extend to the five-way Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game suggested by frontendmentor.
